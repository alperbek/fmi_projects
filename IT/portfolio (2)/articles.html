Recently I played more games on my iPhone than on any other platforms. Realizing this&nbsp;frightening&nbsp;fact -I'm a gamer, please understand me- I started asking myself why I was relying this much on my iPhone games.&nbsp;I started to figure out when and why I was playing my iPhone games. And as you might have guessed my conclusion was mostly time related.<br>

<br>
First I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;that I played iPhone game in places or at moments I almost never played before : waiting for someone in a public place, in my bed just before sleeping, during TV ads, walking to the subway station, before the movie in theater, etc.<br>
Asking myself why I was playing in those situations was pretty obvious,<b> I had small time to kill,&nbsp;very small time to kill.</b>&nbsp;The kind of time my Nintendo DS or PSP can't kill for many reasons : I don't have any of them always in my pocket, they're too slow to boot, their games are not made to kill this kind of time, I don't carry a dozen of&nbsp;cartridges&nbsp;or UMD anywhere with me, I can't buy a new game anywhere and anywhen, etc.<br>
<br>
Then I take a look at iPhone games charts and, as expected, the vast majority of successful game (sales are a special case) are designed to allow short play session : Angry Birds, Bejeweled, Tetris, Doodle Jump, Flight Control ...<br>
<br>

So it's a&nbsp;whole&nbsp;new world for games, a world that started with flash games played at coffee time and now expending to every small moments we often lost doing nothing.<br>
Well, aiming to "short play session game" while making an iPhone games seems to be one way to success. But what about "play session duration" for other platforms and products ?<br>
<br>
I'm convinced that <b>well crafted (game) experience is bound to a good&nbsp;management of the time consumer has to offer</b>.<br>
I mean that games should help player managing their leisure time by cutting the game down to many layers of timed gameplay loop.&nbsp;Why I think it is so important to me and many others ? Because when I start to play a game (or any entertainment)&nbsp;<b>I like to know if it will fit in my schedule</b> and when I could stop playing without being frustrated or lose my progression.<br>

(Talking about entertainment, look at the success of TV shows, 45 minutes session instead of 1h30 for a movie. I bet that's one part of their success)<br>
<br>
As an example I'll take a game I'm currently playing : Alpha Protocol. First because it's fresh in my mind and second because those layers I spoke of are easy to spot and&nbsp;understand in this game.<br>
<br>
Alpha Protocol cut up time this way :<br>
<br>

</div><div class="articles_formatter2">A Checkpoint takes less than five minutes to complete, a Mission a maximum average of an hour, an Objective is about 5 missions and so&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;5 hours, and a Game Acts is nearly 3 objectives&nbsp;approaching&nbsp;a duration of nearly 15 hours. I voluntary extrapolate on some durations but it gives you a good view of how the game cut down its gameplay sessions.</div><div class="articles_formatter2" ><br>

</div><div class="articles_formatter2" >The way Alpha Protocol is divided help player to manage her goals and schedule easily for each play session which is a great advantage. In fact the player knows she could start a 5 minutes play session or a lot more if she likes it or has more time.</div><div class="articles_formatter2" >Moreover&nbsp;this way of cutting up gameplay could help the game to reach&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;design objectives as a well balanced reward system, game pace, puzzle&nbsp;complexity, quest design, etc.</div><div class="articles_formatter2"><br>
</div><div class="articles_formatter2"><br>
</div><div class="articles_formatter2">In summary I think that dividing a game with a "time knife" adapted to its target expectations and free time is something that should not be underestimated.</div>
